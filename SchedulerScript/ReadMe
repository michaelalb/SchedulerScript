This script is meant to manage jobs running on a queue.
The idea is that you want to run the same script on many data sets\points in separate jobs but you dont
necessarily want to occupy the entire queue.
Instead of managing the jobs yourself, you can run this script and every so often it will sample your running jobs
and if there are available slots it will automatically submit a job for you.
this, in theory (this is what i use it for), will allow you to use our cluster much more effectively, as you can utilize
a lot of the hours of the day (and night) without worrying that if your jobs don't finish by morning they will clog the
cluster.
You might have to restructure your script a bit of I have found that once you get used to using this script its quite
useful.
The way to use this script is to fill in the blanks in the SH file in the Repo, and use "qsub {path to the sh file}"
then a "Scheduler job"  will run scheduling the jobs on the datasets you decided until there are no more jobs to run.

WARNING:
because this creates jobs over a long span of time, I HIGHLY RECOMMEND creating a separate copy of the code you want
to run for the scheduler. if you change your target code during the run of the scheduler the code loaded when the job
is created will be different.
